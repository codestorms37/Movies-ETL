# Movies-ETL

Amazing prime video
streaming movies and tv shows on Amazing Prime,
the world's largest online retailer.

## Objective

Develop an algorithm to predict wich low budget movies being released will become popular, so that they can buy streaming rights at a bargain.

To inspire the team, have some fun, and connect with the local coding community, Amazing Prime has decided to sponsor a hackathon. Providing a clean data set of movie data and asking participants to predict the popular pictures.

Brita, a member or the AP video team has been tasked with creating the datasets for the hackathon.

- Two data sources:
  - Wikipedia: scrape of all movies released since 1990
  - Movie Land's rating data
  
Brita needs to extract, transform / clean, consolidate in one data set, and load into a SQL table.
